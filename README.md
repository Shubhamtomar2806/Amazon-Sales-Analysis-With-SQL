# Amazon-Sales-Analysis-With-SQL

The project initiates with the establishment of the "Amazon_database" and creation of the "amazon" table to house Amazon sales data. This table encompasses various fields like Invoice_ID, Branch, City, and more.

Subsequently, SQL queries are executed to scrutinize the dataset and derive valuable insights. These include identifying duplicates, checking for null values, and augmenting columns for further analysis. Further queries address specific inquiries regarding sales trends, revenue generation, product performance, and customer behavior.

Moreover, the analysis uncovers insights such as distinct city and product line counts, prevalent payment methods, top revenue-generating product lines, and dominant customer types. Additionally, gender distribution within branches, predominant customer genders, and peak rating times are explored.

In essence, the project's objective is to offer comprehensive Amazon sales insights through SQL querying and database operations, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic optimization.
